# Backend Reliability Notes

This repository contains short, experience-based notes on building and operating backend and distributed systems in production environments.

The focus is on:
- Reliability and failure handling
- System design trade-offs
- Operational ownership
- Simplicity in long-lived backend systems

These notes are based on real-world work on backend services used in enterprise and security-focused products, primarily in cloud-native and AWS-based environments.

## Topics

- Simplifying distributed backend systems
- Failure modes and blast radius
- Observability and operational signals
- Operational ownership in long-lived systems


The goal is not to present idealized architectures, but to document practical lessons learned while operating systems over time.
